## Prerequisite
- Understanding of Microsoft Azure Cloud Service
- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com)
- Once you have your Azure subscription, create a `Computer Vision resource` in the Azure portal to get your `key` and `endpoint`. After it deploys, click Go to resource.
You will need the `key` and `endpoint` from the resource you created to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You can use the free pricing tier (F0) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Try out the Example
To try out the example app, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/jama5262/MPESA-Business-No-Detector/tree/1.0.0/app) to set up your Azure Vision `key` and `endpoint` environment variables and to run the example on your android phone

## Usage

There are a two ways you can use the library. Either:-
1. Start a vision activity
2. Pass your own bitmap image

### Start vision activity

Add Permissions to Manifest
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

Initialize `MPESABizNoDetector` by passing your Azure Vision credentials

```kotlin
const val CAMERA_REQUEST_CODE = 1

private val mpesaBizNoDetector = MPESABizNoDetector(
    "YOUR_AZURE_VISION_ENDPOINT",
    "YOUR_AZURE_VISION_KEY"
)
```

Start `MPESABizNoDetectorActivity` using the following code

```kotlin
//Make sure you have requested the user for CAMERA permission before continuing

private fun startVisionActivity() {
    mpesaBizNoDetector.startActivity(this@YourActivityClass, CAMERA_REQUEST_CODE)
}

// You can also start the `MPESABizNoDetectorActivity` from a Fragment. See below
private fun startVisionActivity() {
    mpesaBizNoDetector.startActivity(this@YourFragmentClass, CAMERA_REQUEST_CODE)
}
```

Override `onActivityResult` method in your activity or fragment to get the detected business number result

```kotlin
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    if (requestCode == CAMERA_REQUEST_CODE) {
        if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            val detectedBizNo = MPESABizNoDetector.getActivityResult(data!!)

            val type = detectedBizNo.type // TILL_NUMBER or PAYBILL
            val businessNo = detectedBizNo.businessNo
            // The account number can return null if the type is TILL_NUMBER or
            // no account number was detected in the image
            val accountNo = detectedBizNo.accountNo // Can return null
        }
    }
}
```

### Pass your own bitmap image

Add Permissions to Manifest
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

Initialize `MPESABizNoDetector` by passing your Azure Vision credentials

```kotlin
private val mpesaBizNoDetector = MPESABizNoDetector(
    "YOUR_AZURE_VISION_ENDPOINT",
    "YOUR_AZURE_VISION_KEY"
)
```
To detect from a bitmap image, use the following code

```kotlin
private suspend fun detectFromBitmapImage() {
    try {
        val bitmap = getBitmap() // Your bitmap image
        val detectedBizNo = mpesaBizNoDetector.detect(bitmap)
    } catch (e: VisionException) {
        //Vision detection failed, request user to try again
        Log.e(TAG, "Vision Error -> ${e.message}")
    } catch (e: BizNoSearchException) {
        //Image read detected but could not find a valid MPESA
        //business or account number from the image.
        //Request user to try another image and try again
        Log.e(TAG, "Biz number search error -> ${e.message}")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        //Unknown error occured
        Log.e(TAG, "Error found -> ${e.message}")
    }
}
```
